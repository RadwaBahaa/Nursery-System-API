# Nursery System API with Node.js and MongoDB

This project implements a RESTful API for managing a nursery system, allowing users to perform various operations related to managing children, parents, caregivers, and other entities within a nursery environment. The API is built using Node.js and utilizes MongoDB as the database for storing and retrieving data.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure API endpoints.
- **CRUD Operations**: Enable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing children, parents, caregivers, and other entities within the nursery system.
- **Data Validation**: Implement input validation using middleware to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Relationships and Associations**: Establish relationships and associations between entities (e.g., children, parents, caregivers) using MongoDB's document-oriented approach.
- **Error Handling**: Implement centralized error handling to provide consistent and informative error responses to API consumers.
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Define RESTful endpoints for interacting with the nursery system, adhering to best practices in API design.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime for building scalable and efficient web applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js used to build the API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing nursery system data in a flexible document format.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for Node.js and MongoDB, providing a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- **Express Validator**: Middleware for Express.js used for input validation and sanitization.
- **Bcrypt.js**: Library for hashing passwords to securely store user credentials in the database.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a scalable and efficient API backend for managing a nursery system. The API facilitates interactions between clients (e.g., web applications, mobile apps) and the database, allowing for seamless data management and retrieval within the nursery environment.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized following best practices in Node.js application architecture:

- **Routes**: Define API routes for handling different types of requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Controllers**: Implement controller functions that handle the business logic for processing requests and interacting with the database.
- **Models**: Define Mongoose models representing data entities (e.g., Child, Parent, Caregiver) and their schema definitions.
- **Middleware**: Implement middleware functions for tasks such as authentication, authorization, and input validation.
- **Utils**: Include utility functions for common tasks (e.g., generating JWT tokens, hashing passwords).

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for this API could include:

- Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) for managing user permissions.
- Adding support for file uploads (e.g., child photos, documents).
- Integrating real-time features using WebSockets for live updates within the nursery system.

## Getting Started

To run the API locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   *git clone https://github.com/your-username/nursery-system-api.git*

2. Install dependencies:
   *cd nursery-system-api*
    *npm install*

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file and configure environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection string, JWT secret key).

4. Start the server:
   *npm start*
   
5. Access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or integrate with a front-end application.
